## At First Glance
Admittedly, the majority of my time in school has been governed by the same cycle: memorize, then purge, memorize, then purge.  My only goal throughout highschool was to get straight As and get into the best college possible, not to learn.  This has only begun to change recently when I started my sophomore year of college and I began to see how the things I learned in past classes bled into the next.  Taking ICS 314 has only aided in further changing my perspective.

At the beginning of the semester, I expected ICS 314 to be a simple class where I made pretty websites for an hour or so then went about my day.  I never realized until I was knee deep in the course how complicated, yet rewarding software engineering can be.  From development environments to software engineering ethics, the various topics I learned in this class have not only given me a greater appreciation for software developers, but also provided me with several new tools I can use both in future software development projects and other endeavors.
