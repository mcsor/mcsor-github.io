## At First Glance
ICS 314

## In Progress
Admittedly, the majority of my time in school has been governed by the same cycle: memorize, then purge, memorize, then purge.  My only goal throughout highschool was to get straight As and get into the best college possible, not to learn.  This has only begun to change recently when I started my sophomore year of college and I began to see how the things I learned in past classes bled into the next.  ICS 314 has only aided in changing my perspective.

## On To The Next
