## Initial Thoughts
As a person who feels most at ease with at least some form of rules and order, I have no particular grievance against coding standards.  This extends to ESLint with IntelliJ.  Although I do sometimes find getting the green checkmark a little annoying, for the most part, I have found that the way I code mostly matches the ESLint coding standard.  Therefore, it has not given me that big of a problem so far.  However, I can see how it can become annoying for other coders who prefer a coding style much different than the one enforced by ESLint.

## From the Basics
In a way, coding can be seen as a creative endeavor; everyone has their own style of thinking and everyone has their own style of coding.  I strongly believe, however, coding standards are essential for beginner and intermediate coders who are just learning and beginning to understand coding.  By providing a template for coders to write their code based off of, it teaches them how to write efficient and effective code.  It also makes code easier to read which makes it easier for both the coder and other people to identify and fix bugs.

However, once a coder starts becoming more advanced I believe it should be allowed to break at least some coding standard rules.
