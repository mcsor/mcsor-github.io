## Exploring UI Frameworks
Despite having played around with HTML, Javascript and CSS for a while now, Bootstrap 5 was my first encounter with a UI Framework.  Although I do find it helpful in some aspects, learning how to use it for the past 2 weeks has been both frustrating and rewarding.  Given my current workload and unforgiving schedule, I have found it hard to carve out the time needed to explore Bootstrap 5 and get more used to working with it.  The sheer amount of utility provided by Bootstrap 5 was, at first, hard to sift through and fully understand.  However, after lots of practice and trial and error, I slowly began to understand the usefulness of the UI Framework.

Once you are able to get past the initial learning curve, however, I believe UI Frameworks makes your life a lot easier when designing a website.  For example, in Bootstrap 5, by simply including the class “container” in your HTML tag, the framework automatically provides you with a general padding for the content of your website.  This saves you the trouble of having to go through the effort to manually add in the HTML and CSS code to perform this task yourself.  Besides container, Bootstrap 5 includes a large variety of other classes (ex. navbar, row, col) that, when called, provide an easier way to design websites and allows coders to cut down on the amount of code they need to write.
