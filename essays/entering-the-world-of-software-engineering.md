## Initial Thoughts
Prior to ICS 314 I already had some experience with building websites and therefore was already familiar with Javascript.  The programming language is, in its own respects, rather simple and admittedly is one of my more favored languages to code in.  From a software engineering perspective, I believe Javascript to be a very useful programming language as there is less of a need to be specific when coding (for example, there is no need to specify variable or return types).  This provides the coder with more flexibility and, in my opinion, a more enjoyable coding experience.  Not only are software engineers allowed more time to focus on the design of their software systems, but also makes it one of the easier programming languages to pick up especially by people who have had no prior coding experience.

## Journey into ES6
Compared to regular Javascript, I found ES6 a little harder to use.  Although it’s over-simplicity makes it significantly faster to type (granted, this is only if you know what you’re doing), because I prefer coding languages that are more similar to the English language, ES6 was a little of a challenge to  something you do not get with ES6.

## Athletic Software Engineering
In the case of athletic software engineering, I personally find it quite the stressful experience.  As a person who does not fare very well under pressure – especially when a time limit is involved – my WOD (“workout of the day”) experiences thus far have been less than pleasant.  Despite this, however, I believe they will prove useful in helping me get better at working under stressful circumstances as well as improve my problem solving skills which will ultimately help me in the workplace.
