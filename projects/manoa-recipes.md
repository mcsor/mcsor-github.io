# Overview

Manoa Recipes is an application I made as part of a group project for my ICS 314 class that aims to provide college students easy access to low budget, simple recipes they can make at home.  Users are able to look through recipes uploaded to the site as well as add their own.  By using the search page, users can look for recipes based off of specific ingredients.  Additionally, the "List Recipe" page has a filter feature that allows the user to filter out vegan and gluten-free recipes.

</div>

Depending on the role the user chooses, a different profile is available.  If they are a regular user, their profile displays their allergies, and whether they are vegan and/or gluten-free.  If they are a vendor, their profile displays their name, location, and hours as well as the ingredients they sell.

# Responsibilities
For this project, I was mainly in charge of creating the landing page and the vendor profile.

# Takeaways
Throughout my years as a student, I have inevitably worked on many group projects before.  However, this is the first time I've worked on a group coding project.  Because I'm used to working on coding projects myself, it took me a little while to get used to coding as a group.
