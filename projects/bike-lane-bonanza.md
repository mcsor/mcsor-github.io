To celebrate the opening of the new bike lane on Oahu, my Climate Crew Cohort III worked together with Blue Planet Organization to plan and host a bike lane challenge we titled "Bike Lane Bonanza."  The goal of this project was to bring attention towards the bike lane and to encourage more people to use it.

As part of the advertising team, I, and two other team members, worked together to create posters for the event and post them on instagram.
