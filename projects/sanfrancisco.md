For my 3D animation class I was tasked with creating an environment scene in Maya to practice modeling with primitive shapes.  As a big fan of the San Francisco scenery, I chose to recreate a San Francisco street.  

Because this was the first time I had ever touched Maya, I started off simple, using mainly cubes to create the buildings on my street.  After getting used to the basics, I moved on to create more complicated structures like my lamps.

I struggled a lot with rigging the lighting of the lamps and spent at least two weeks trying to figure out why the lamp lighting would show up in my scene in Maya, but not in my rendered images.
